# Project Site

This is a project & recruitment website for a lucky Researcher I know. It's built on Jekyll with a customized version of the [ Massively ]( https://github.com/iwiedenm/jekyll-theme-massively-src ) theme, and hosted in an S3 bucket. 

If I'm being honest, I like the look of Massively but I dislike its code. The main.css file is 4500 lines long and 85kb. The HTML is divs on top of divs, there are few semantic elements. The documentation is not meant for people who will be digging into the CSS. I wish I had looked closer before deciding on this theme; next time I'll be more careful.
