        <b>The 2 year project, <i>A new generation of the lithium battery: assembly of the all-solid-state system</i> is awarded to the
            Project Manager and is carried out within the 5th edition of the Homing programme of the Foundation for Polish Science
            co-financed by the European Union under the European Regional Development Fund.

        <b>The project manager will lead the group of one PhD and two master students. This project is located at the Faculty of
            Chemistry, University of Warsaw in the Laboratory of Electrochemical Power Sources. The Team Leader of this laboratory
            is Prof. Andrzej Czerwi≈Ñski, an expert in energy storage systems and a highly experienced research and development
            scientist and inventor. His laboratory is fully equipped for electrochemical studies on lithium technologies. Highly
            qualified scientific Mentors, both Polish and international, will closely collaborate with the project manager and
            students to ensure the success of this proposal. This project is divided into the three parts: battery electrode
            and electrolyte preparation and testing, ASSB assembly and optimization, and revealing the ionic conduction mechanism
            based on the results.</b>

    <h3>Aims of the project</h3>
    <p>
        Larger polarizability of the anions in the same structure allows for similar hopping-site environments and lower the activation
        energy barriers, greatly increase the ionic conductivity. This is why sulfur-based superconductors are the first choice
        for this project, before trying the oxide materials. Lithium metal anode and several different types of modern cathodes
        will be applied to test their compatibility in an all-solid-state battery (ASSB) system. There are several demonstrations
        of such ASSBs, but in order to improve their electrochemical performance it is necessary to prepare good interfaces between
        the electrodes and solid electrolyte. Several chemical approaches to improve those contacts will be tested, as well as
        battery assembly improvements. The correct formation of the interfaces will provide a better ionic conduction path, another
        purpose of this study. Even though the assembly of an ASSB might be more tricky in a sulfide-based system, the effort
        and success of such configuration will lead to the filing of an attractive patent application.

    <p>
        The relationship of a dynamic lattice to the ionic conductivity of these systems is still not fully understood, so in collaboration
        with Department of Physics, the Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden, we plan to provide evidence on how changing
        the atoms in a sublattice affects its ionic transport and structural properties. We would like to combine structural
        characterization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and theoretical calculation on the ionic transport in studied
        materials to find the theoretical explanation of their conduction mechanism. This research can be a stepping stone to
        a better understanding of ionic transport in these materials, helping choose accurate technological strategies.
