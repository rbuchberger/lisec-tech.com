        My name is Maciej Boczar. I am a PhD student at the Faculty of Chemistry, University of
        Warsaw. During my MSc. and PhD studies, I worked as a researcher in various scientific and
        R&D projects on new materials and manufacturing methods for lithium-ion batteries. I joined
        the Prof. Andrzej Czerwiński Group in 2014 willing to work on modern technologies applicable
        to the society. I co-authored 5 scientific publications and 6 international conference
        presentations. I have joined this Project since I want to expand my interest and knowledge
        about new battery materials and their structural, morphological and electrochemical
        evaluation.

        My name is Justyna, I am an engineer of Technical Physics. Nowadays I am doing my master's studies
        at the Faculty of Physics, Warsaw University of Technology. I am interested in solid-state physics
        and electrochemistry, especially in conventional lithium-ion batteries with liquid electrolyte.
        Results from my engineer's thesis had been published in ECS Transactions in 2017 and its extended
        version sent to the Journal of Electrochemical Society. My science posters were presented at five
        conferences, e.g. The 232nd Electrochemical Society Meeting (Washington, USA) and Open Readings
        (Vilnius, Lithuania). This project is closely related to my interests, but it also gives me an
        opportunity to expand my knowledge about new technologies.
