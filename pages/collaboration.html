    <h2>Collaboration</h2>
    <p>There are 4 scientific institutions collaborating with the Project manager, namely: <b>University of Louisville</b> (USA), <b>Chalmers University of Technology</b> (Sweden), <b>Warsaw University of Technology</b> (Poland) and the <b>Institute of Electronic Materials Technology</b> (Poland). Six highly qualified scientific Mentors will closely collaborate with the project manager and students to ensure the success of this project. The Mentors were chosen based on their high experience and knowledge on particular subjects covered by this project and will provide guidance for all team members. Mentors are assigned to most of the project subsections to ensure merit and result quality during the proposed research. Team members will have the chance to spend a few months at partner institutions, using the high-quality resources they have available.</p>
