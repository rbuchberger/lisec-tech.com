I am happy to inform that the PCT/US2020/028471 international patent application was filed April 16, 2020. This invention will be shared between the University of Louisville and the University of Warsaw. I thank both parties for their help. I would like to congratulate to my partners and co-inventors: Dr. Hui Wang, and Dr. Thad Druffel! This application covers the method for wet chemical synthesis of lithium argyrodites, the materials that are one of the most promising solid-state electrolytes in next generation Li batteries.
