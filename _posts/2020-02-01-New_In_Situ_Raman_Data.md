Maciej came back from his international internship in USA. He collected many interesting structural and morphological data on battery materials. Especially important are in situ Raman data collected on working Li-ion battery. He observed the cycling performance in connection with the structural changes. He focused on the high voltage window and possibility to use such cathode materials once better high-voltage electrolytes will be available. He also started ex situ examination of the electrodes (XRD and XPS) which he plans to continue here, at the University of Warsaw.
