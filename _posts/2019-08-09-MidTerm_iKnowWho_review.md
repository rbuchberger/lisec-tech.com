This week 2 coworkers and I from the University of Warsaw attended the Mid-Term
review of the iKNOW-WHO Challenge. The meeting was organized in Senoren, Sweden
between 7th and 8 th August 2019. All attending groups presented their current
works and achievements and the Biotronik company had a chance to evaluate these
mini-projects. We had a chance to scientifically discuss found challenges and
network with some European university groups as well to further discuss possible
doubts/comments about shown results with Biotronik staff to better understand
their point of view and company vision. This is a really interesting experience
since none of us have taken part in such an initiative before, and it will also
improve our interpersonal skills.
