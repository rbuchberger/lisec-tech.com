We are happy to announce that thanks to the Foundation for Polish Science we
welcome a new battery tester with an EIS module in our laboratory this month.
This equipment has 8 channels and will greatly improve our efficiency in the
project. We will now be able to perform measurements such as
chronopotentiometry, cyclic voltammetry as well as EIS characteristics.
