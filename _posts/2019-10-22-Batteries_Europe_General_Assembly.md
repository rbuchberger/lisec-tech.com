As a member of the BATTERIES 2030+ initiative, I participated today in **BatteRies Europe** Working Group 1 (New & Emerging Battery Technologies) meeting and General Assembly organized by the European Commission. The WG1 composed of European researchers working on batteries discussed on the novel energy storage technologies, battery research and funding that should be focused on during the next EU perspective (2021-2027). Furthermore, the general remarks and recommendations of the WG1 panel was shown during the General Assembly at the EC.
