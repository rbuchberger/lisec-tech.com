On Janury 17th, 2019, we have published, together with collaborators from University of Louisville, a [new paper on solid state electrolyte synthesis](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.8b19181):

**Rapid and Economic Synthesis of a Li7PS6 Solid Electrolyte from a Liquid Approach**

Authors: Dominika A. Ziolkowska, William Arnold, Thad Druffel, Mahendra Sunkara, and Hui Wang 

The prepared Li7PS6 solid electrolyte shows a high phase purity, very good ionic conductivity (0.11 mS cm–1), and a reasonably stable electrochemical window vs. a metallic lithium anode. We highlight the use of an economic and nontoxic solvent for a quick synthesis of a Li7PS6 solid electrolyte, which would promote the development of solid-state batteries for next-generation energy storage systems.
