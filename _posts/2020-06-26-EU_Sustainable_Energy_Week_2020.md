I participated in the EU Sustainable Energy Week (EUSEW) which is the biggest annual event dedicated to renewables and efficient energy use in Europe organized by the European Commission.

Between 22-26 June 2020, participants enjoyed an online event under the theme: ‘Beyond the crisis: clean energy for green recovery and growth’.

Several important remarks were made by the battery manufactures in Europe and EC representatives working on the next EU perspective so-called “EU Green Deal”.
