I would like to introduce my new team member: **Krzysztof Słupczyński** who recently joined this project.

### KRZYSZTOF SŁUPCZYŃSKI

Krzysztof is a Master student at the Faculty of Chemistry, University of Warsaw where he studies Physical Chemistry. He is interested in solid state chemistry, electrochemistry and new technologies. He started his journey with laboratory work during few previous internships including battery technologies and his work at chemical company. As a young researcher, he is very interested in new discoveries and thus I hope he will enjoy work in our group on all-solid-state batteries.

**We welcome Krzysztof in my research group and I am looking forward to productive and successful research with him.**
