I had the pleasure to take part in the Biotronik challenge organized by the
I-Know-Who company in Berlin (Germany). Our battery group from the University
of Warsaw was invited to participate in the competition about new bio-medical
energy storage systems to be used in future pacemakers produce by Biotronik
(Litronik) company. During this trip we had several interesting meetings with
officials from the R&D departments of this company, saw their current
production plant, and understoo their challenge much better. We are looking
forward to possibly fulfilling their requirements and providing interesting
solutions for their applications.
