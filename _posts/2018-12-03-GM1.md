Today I had a chance to meet with **Prof. [Patrik Johansson](https://mobile.twitter.com/patrik_chalmers)** during his short Warsaw visit.

It was our first reunion after almost 9 years once I was his MSc student over a MESC#5 program! We had a chance to **discuss the new project in-person, its challanges, additional experimental possibilities and plan our future meetings.** It was a really constructive reunion hold in a very friendly (as always!) atmosphere.

Thank you Patrik for today talk and again Merry Christamas and Happy New Year 2019!
