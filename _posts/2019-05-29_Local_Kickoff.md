This week we hosted a Biotronic R&D employee and I-Know-How personnel at the
Faculty of Chemistry University of Warsaw. We showed them our laboratories and
equipment. They had a chance to look closer at the battery preparation
techniques, our battery set-ups, characterization methods etc. we established in
Warsaw. We had a few meeting afterwards to discuss the most important milestones
and questions. We look forward to the next meeting in August.
