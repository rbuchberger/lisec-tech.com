I would like to introduce my new motivated team members: **Maciej Boczar**, MSc.
and **Justyna Frąckiewicz**, Eng. who recently joined this project.

### Maciej Boczar

Maciej is a PhD student at the Faculty of Chemistry, University of Warsaw and
for the next 2 years will continue his work in my group. He has a background in
chemistry (with an emphasis on physical chemistry, and especially interested in
electrochemistry).  He worked on various energy storage projects for more than 4
years and gained additional experience during several R&D internships (both
Italy and Poland). He co-authored several research papers and conference
presentations on new battery material. His thesis topic covers the application
of novel cathode materials in lithium-ion batteries.

### Justyna Frąckiewicz

Justyna is a Master student at the Faculty of Physics, Warsaw University of
Technology where she studies Technical Physics. She is interested in solid state
physics and electrochemistry and thus she found this project very interesting.
As a young researcher, she already co-authored a paper in the international
journal and conference presentations based on her Engineering Thesis foundings.
 

**I welcome Maciej and Justyna in my first research group and I am looking
forward to productive and successful research with them.**
