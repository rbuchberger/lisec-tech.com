On July 15th, 2020, we have published, together with collaborators from University of Louisville, a new paper on solid state electrolyte synthesis:

**Halide doping effect on solvent-synthesized lithium argyrodites Li6PS5X (X= Cl, Br, I) superionic conductors**

Authors: *William Arnold, Dominika A. Buchberger, Yang Li, Mahendra Sunkara, Thad Druffel, Hui Wang*

The paper covers a new solvent-based synthesis of Li₆PS₅X argyrodites and Li₆PS₅Cl·xLiCl. Li₆PS₅Cl material shows the best Li-ion conductivity (0.34 mS cm−1) among three halide ions (Cl, Br, I). Excess Cl in Li₆PS₅Cl·LiCl increases Li-ion conductvity to 0.53 mS cm−1 at 25 °C. Although LiCl secondary phase appears when Cl doping content is high.
