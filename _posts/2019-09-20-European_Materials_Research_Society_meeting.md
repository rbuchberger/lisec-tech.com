On 16th Sep Maciej Boczar presented his talk during the E-MRS Fall Meeting held
in Warsaw (Poland) at the Warsaw University of Technology. This presentation,
entitled: NMC ELECTRODE STABILIZATION STUDY FOR HIGH-VOLTAGE BATTERY
APPLICATIONS, was found very interesting by the audience. He received several
comments and questions and had a chance to discuss his topic with gathered
researchers. During this conference we had an opportunity to listen to several
talks and see posters presented on lithium battery and post lithium technologies
(Na-ion batteries, Zn-batteries, all-solid-state systems, solid electrolytes,
supercapacitors etc.). We also had an occasion to step back and reevaluate some
of our goals.
