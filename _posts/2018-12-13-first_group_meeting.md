Today, Maciej and Justyna joined in our first Group Meeting. Since now
we will meet together on a biweekly basis discuss current results, new
directions, new literature findings to stayed tuned with other
researchers. They both presented short reports about their field of
interest (literature search and first results). We have a really great
scientific brainstorm and I hope it gave them as much of an additional
motivation as I gained today.

Thank you my TEAM!
