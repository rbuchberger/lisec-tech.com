The project has been extended by the Foundation for Polish Science to the end of June 2021 due to pandemic circumstances and technical challenges we faced on the way. Thanks to this extension we will be able to sum-up our research on high-voltage cathode structural investigations including theoretical DFT calculations, solid-state electrolyte improvements with detailed analysis on conduction mechanism (including temperature EIS and NMR studies) and thin layer all-solid-state battery design trails and prototype selection.
