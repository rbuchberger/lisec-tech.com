I have a pleasure to announce that I was invited to the **AVL  Software and Functions** company and had a very interesting meeting and discussion about all-solid-state batteries including expecations and perspective of the industial sector. This was a very informative session to me and refreshed my viewpoint on the manufacture needs.
I hope that I also identified the scientific challanges we are phasing right now working on this energy storage problem. 

Thank you **AVL  Software and Functions** for a networking experience and hope to find a common goals in the future.
