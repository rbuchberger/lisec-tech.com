Over the last 2 days Maciej Boczar and I attended a very interesting
Interdisicplinary FNP Conference held in Warsaw, Poland. We had the opportunity
to present a poster presentation showing the aims and challenges of this project
(“Challenges of a new generation lithium battery: finding suitable components
for the all-solid-state system”), and talk to other FNP laureates working on
similar topics. We enjoyed many lectures and discussion with researchers and FNP
personnel. This was very constructive and informative meeting.
